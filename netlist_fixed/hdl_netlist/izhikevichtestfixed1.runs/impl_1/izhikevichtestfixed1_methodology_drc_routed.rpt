There is a large setup violation of -7.955 ns between izhikevichtestfixed1_struct/v_mux/pipe_16_22_reg[2][13]_replica_1/C (clocked by clk) and izhikevichtestfixed1_struct/bv/comp0.core_instance0/U0/i_mult/gDSP.gDSP_only.iDSP/use_prim.appDSP48[3].bppDSP48[2].use_dsp.use_dsp48e1.iDSP48E1/PCIN[8] (clocked by clk). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
